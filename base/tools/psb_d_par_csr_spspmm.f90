!
!  This routine computes a  parallel product of two sparse matrices
!
!         C = A * B 
!
!  where all the matrices are stored in CSR. On input and output the matrices
!  are stored with column indices in local numbering, but inermediate quantities
!  are in global numbering because gathering the halo of B to multiply it
!  by A implies a potential enlargement of the support.
!  Also, B may have a column index space different from its row index space,
!  which is obviously the same as the column  space of A. 
! 
!
! Arguments:
!    acsr       -  type(psb_d_csr_sparse_mat), input.     
!                  The sparse matrix structure A 
!    desc_a     -  type(psb_desc_type), input.
!                  The communication descriptor of the column space of A
!    bcsr       -  type(psb_d_csr_sparse_mat), input/output.     
!                  The sparse matrix structure B, gets row-extended on output 
!    ccsr       -  type(psb_d_csr_sparse_mat), output      
!                  The sparse matrix structure C 
!    desc_c     -  type(psb_desc_type), input/output.
!                  The communication descriptor of the column space of B
!
!    info       -  integer, output.

  !
  ! This is a bit tricky.
  ! DESC_A is the descriptor of (the columns of) A, and therefore
  ! of the rows of B; the columns of B, in the intended usage, span
  ! a different space for which we have DESC_C. 
  ! We are gathering the halo rows of B to multiply by A;
  ! now, the columns of B would ideally be kept in
  ! global numbering, so that we can call this repeatedly to accumulate
  ! the product of multiple operators, and convert to local numbering
  ! at the last possible moment. However, this would imply calling
  ! the serial SPSPMM with a matrix B with the GLOBAL number of columns
  ! and this could be very expensive in memory. The solution is to keep B
  ! in local numbering, so that only columns really appearing count, but to
  ! expand the descriptor when gathering the halo, because by performing
  ! the products we are extending the support of the operator; hence
  ! this routine is intended to be called with a temporary descriptor
  ! DESC_C which is in the BUILD state, to allow for such expansion
  ! across multiple products. 
  ! The caller will at some later point finalize the descriptor DESC_C.
