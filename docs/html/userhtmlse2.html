<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >The PSBLAS library is designed to handle the implementation of iterative solvers for
sparse linear systems on distributed memory parallel computers. The system
coefficient matrix <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>must be square; it may be real or complex, nonsymmetric, and
its sparsity pattern needs not to be symmetric. The serial computation parts are
based on the serial sparse BLAS, so that any extension made to the data structures
of the serial kernels is available to the parallel version. The overall design and
parallelization strategy have been influenced by the structure of the ScaLAPACK
parallel library. The layered structure of the PSBLAS library is shown in figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x4-30011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:psblas --></a>;
lower layers of the library indicate an encapsulation relationship with upper
layers. The ongoing discussion focuses on the Fortran&#x00A0;2003 layer immediately
below the application layer. The serial parts of the computation on each
process are executed through calls to the serial sparse BLAS subroutines. In a
similar way, the inter-process message exchanges are encapsulated in an
applicaiton layer that has been strongly inspired by the Basic Linear Algebra
Communication Subroutines (BLACS) library&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="userhtmlli2.html#XBLACS">7</a>]</span>. Usually there is no need to deal
directly with MPI; however, in some cases, MPI routines are used directly
to improve efficiency. For further details on our communication layer see

<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   The type of linear system matrices that we address typically arise in
the numerical solution of PDEs; in such a context, it is necessary to pay
special attention to the structure of the problem from which the application
originates. The nonzero pattern of a matrix arising from the discretization of a
PDE is influenced by various factors, such as the shape of the domain, the
discretization strategy, and the equation/unknown ordering. The matrix itself can be
interpreted as the adjacency matrix of the graph associated with the discretization
mesh.
<!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   The distribution of the coefficient matrix for the linear system is based on the
&#8220;owner computes&#8221; rule: the variable associated to each mesh point is assigned to a
process that will own the corresponding row in the coefficient matrix and will
carry out all related computations. This allocation strategy is equivalent to a
partition of the discretization mesh into <span 
class="cmti-10">sub-domains</span>. Our library supports any
distribution that keeps together the coefficients of each matrix row; there are no
other constraints on the variable assignment. This choice is consistent with
simple data distributions such as <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">CYCLIC(N)</span></span></span> and <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">BLOCK</span></span></span>, as well as completely
arbitrary assignments of equation indices to processes. In particular it is
consistent with the usage of graph partitioning tools commonly available in
the literature, e.g. METIS&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="userhtmlli2.html#XMETIS">14</a>]</span>. Dense vectors conform to sparse matrices,
that is, the entries of a vector follow the same distribution of the matrix
rows.
<!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >   We assume that the sparse matrix is built in parallel, where each process generates
its own portion. We never require that the entire matrix be available on a single
node. However, it is possible to hold the entire matrix in one process and distribute it
explicitly<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="userhtml5.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x4-3002f1"></a> ,
even though the resulting memory bottleneck would make this option unattractive in
most cases.
